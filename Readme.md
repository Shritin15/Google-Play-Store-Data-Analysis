Google Play Store App Analytics Project

Project Overview
o This project is an end-to-end data analysis case study focused on the Google Play Store mobile app market. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of user behaviour, app ratings, and market trends to deliver actionable business insights. This project showcases proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, advanced statistical analysis, and data visualization.

 Key Questions & Findings
o Key Questions & Findings 
o What are the most saturated app categories?
 The analysis shows that the 'FAMILY' and 'GAME' categories are the most populated, indicating a highly competitive market.
 
o Is there a correlation between an app's rating and its number of installs?
 A scatter plot reveals no clear correlation between ratings and installs. This suggests that factors beyond product quality, such as marketing and app store optimization, are major drivers of an app's success.

o Do paid apps have a different rating than free apps?
 A two-sample t-test was performed, resulting in a p-value of 0.000. This confirms a statistically significant difference in ratings, with paid apps having a measurably higher average rating. 

o Does user sentiment in reviews impact an app's rating?
 A sentiment analysis on user reviews showed a strong positive correlation between the positivity of reviews and an app's average rating.

 Actionable Recommendations
o Monetization Strategy:
 The analysis of ratings for paid vs. free apps suggests that users are more satisfied with paid products. It is recommended to explore premium, paid versions for high-performing free apps to potentially increase user satisfaction and revenue.

o Review Management:
 The strong correlation between sentiment and ratings highlights the importance of user feedback. We recommend a proactive approach to monitoring and addressing user reviews to improve app ratings and user loyalty
